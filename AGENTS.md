# AGENTS.md — RedefineNCM KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform)

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. **This document is the
authoritative target specification.** It describes the architecture the project is
converging toward, the decisions that have been locked in, and — in one bounded section
near the end (["Current divergence from this spec"](#current-divergence-from-this-spec)) —
the ways the code on disk does not yet match it.

> **Read this first, then read [`../RedefineNCM/AGENTS.md`](../RedefineNCM/AGENTS.md).**
> The original Android app is the reference implementation for feature behavior.

> ⚠️ **This document distinguishes _decision_ from _fact_.** Architecture decisions (which
> targets, which source-set names, which library replaces which) are made here and are
> binding. External facts that this environment cannot verify — chiefly "what is the latest
> published version of library X" — are **never asserted**. Where a version must be chosen,
> the doc says so and defers to a verification pass. The previous version of this file
> asserted aspiration as fact (claimed dependencies, versions, and SQLDelight that do not
> exist); that is the failure mode this rewrite exists to prevent. Do not reintroduce it.

## What this is

RedefineNCM KMP is a Kotlin Multiplatform port of the original Android-only
[RedefineNCM](https://github.com/RedSTARO/RedefineNCM) — a third-party **NetEase Cloud Music
(网易云音乐)** client. The original Android codebase is in the sibling `../RedefineNCM`
directory and is the reference for feature behavior, API encoding, and UI/interaction design.

Targets, in priority order:

| Target | Priority | Distinguishing platform feature |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | P0 | Live-update **notification** lyric (`MediaStyle` / custom notification) |
| **iOS** | P0 | **Live Activities → 灵动岛 (Dynamic Island)** + Lock Screen lyric |
| **Desktop / JVM** | P0 | **Floating always-on-top desktop-lyrics window** + **Windows SMTC** (System Media Transport Controls); MPRIS on Linux, MPNowPlayingInfoCenter on macOS |
| **Web / WASM** | P3 (lowest) | Basic playback; scaffolded, not feature-complete |

The app talks to a self-hosted
[NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi)-style backend
(base URL is user-configurable in Settings). All API communication is JSON over HTTP,
typically against a server on the same LAN or localhost (so cleartext HTTP must be allowed).

### Active goals driving current work

1. Complete the KMP migration to all four targets (Android, iOS, Desktop first; Web last).
2. Per-platform "now playing" surfaces: Android notification → **iOS Dynamic Island**,
   **desktop floating lyric window**, **Windows media protocol (SMTC)**.
3. **Material 3 Expressive** UI, applied consistently here **and** kept aligned in the
   original Android repo.
4. **Upgrade all dependencies to latest** — see [Dependency management](#dependency-management).
   This is a *verified* pass (check Maven Central / release notes); it must also **converge
   the two repos' shared versions** (Kotlin, coroutines, serialization, AGP), which are
   currently skewed.

---

## Locked architecture decisions

These were ambiguous or contradicted by the prior doc. They are now decided. Do not
re-litigate without recording a new decision here.

### D1 — Desktop source set is `jvmMain` (not `desktopMain`)

`shared/build.gradle.kts` declares the desktop target as a **bare `jvm()`**, so the Kotlin
Gradle plugin names the source set **`jvmMain`** (and `jvmTest`). The `desktopMain/` and
`desktopTest/` directories present on disk are **dead, byte-identical duplicates** and must
be deleted. All desktop-specific code lives in `jvmMain/`. (If a future change switches to
`jvm("desktop")`, do the rename in one commit and update this decision — do not leave both.)

### D2 — `wasmJs` target is intentionally deferred (web is P3)

`wasmJsMain/` source exists but the `wasmJs` target is **deliberately not declared** in
`shared/build.gradle.kts` yet — so that source is currently dormant (not compiled). Rationale:
web is the lowest priority, and declaring the target pulls web-only deps whose versions add
risk to the P0 build (`ktor-client-js`, `kotlinx-browser` for `localStorage`). When web is
prioritized, declare `wasmJs { browser(); binaries.executable() }`, add those deps, and
reconcile `Platform.wasm.kt` with the real `Platform` interface. Stubs are acceptable; full
parity is not required.

### D3 — Local cache is SQLDelight — **DONE (updated 2026-07-04)**

The original caches via Room (cache-then-network). The KMP replacement is **SQLDelight**, now
fully wired: plugin + 9 `.sq` tables under `shared/src/commonMain/sqldelight/` (user detail /
user playlist / playlist detail / playlist tracks / recommend ×2 / lyric / comment /
**PlayerStatus**) + `DatabaseDriverFactory` expect/actuals (android/native/sqlite). `Repository`
implements cache-then-network for all cached endpoints and persists/restores the play queue
via the `PlayerStatus` table.

### D4 — Notification / now-playing surfaces are one common contract, four platform actuals

`commonMain` owns the contract; each platform renders it natively:

- **`notification/LyricNotificationController`** — `expect object` with
  `updateLyric(title, artist, currentLyric, nextLyric, artworkUri)`, `clearFocus()`,
  `reset()`. This is the **lyric display** surface.
- **`smtc/MediaControlsIntegrator`** — common `object` holding `MediaControlMetadata`
  (title/artist/album/artwork/duration/position/isPlaying) for OS media controls. This is
  the **transport controls** surface. (It currently lives in a file misnamed
  `WindowsSmtcIntegration.kt` — see divergence list.)

Platform actuals:

| Platform | Lyric surface (`LyricNotificationController`) | Transport surface |
|---|---|---|
| Android | Live-update `Notification` (MediaStyle / custom RemoteViews) on a channel | Media3 `MediaSession` |
| iOS | ActivityKit **Live Activity** → Dynamic Island + Lock Screen | `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` / `MPRemoteCommandCenter` |
| Desktop (JVM) | Frameless, always-on-top **Compose floating window** | **Windows SMTC** (JNA/COM); **MPRIS** (D-Bus) on Linux |
| Web (WASM) | No-op stub | No-op stub |

**iOS bridge pattern (decided):** Kotlin does **not** call ActivityKit directly. The Kotlin
`LyricNotificationController` writes a `LiveActivityData` value (mirrored as a Swift
`Codable`) into an **App Group `NSUserDefaults`**; a **Swift Widget Extension** target reads
it and drives the Live Activity. The Widget Extension target does not exist in the Xcode
project yet (TODO).

## Toolchain

Versions below are the **actual current state** of `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and
`gradle.properties` — not a recommendation and not necessarily "latest" (goal #4 is a
separate, verified upgrade pass; see [Dependency management](#dependency-management)).

| Component | Current value | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| AGP | `9.0.1` | `libs.versions.toml: agp` — see note: 9.2.0 deferred |
| Kotlin | `2.4.0` | `libs.versions.toml: kotlin` — bumped + build-verified 2026-06-11 |
| Compose Multiplatform | `1.11.1` | `libs.versions.toml: composeMultiplatform` |
| Compose Material3 (JB) | `1.11.0-alpha07` | `libs.versions.toml: material3` (pinned independently; Expressive APIs) |
| kotlinx-coroutines | `1.11.0` | `libs.versions.toml: kotlinx-coroutines` |
| Android compileSdk / minSdk / targetSdk | `36` / `24` / `36` | `libs.versions.toml: android-*` |
| Gradle (wrapper) | `9.1.0` | `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` |
| JDK | 17+ | — |

> **Convergence status (goal #4):** Kotlin is now `2.4.0` in BOTH repos (converged + verified).
> **AGP stays at `9.0.1` here** while the original is `9.2.0`: bumping the KMP repo to AGP 9.2.0
> requires Gradle ≥ 9.4.1, and after that it fails to resolve `aapt2:9.2.0` and breaks
> configuration-cache serialization (empirically tested 2026-06-11). Not worth breaking the green
> build for AGP parity — revisit when those AGP-9.2 issues are resolved or config-cache is off.

> **Build IS verifiable here (Android + Desktop), corrected 2026-06-11.** The Android SDK is
> present and the JVM toolchain works. **Verified green:** `:shared:compileKotlinJvm`,
> `:desktopApp:compileKotlin`, `:shared:jvmTest` (PlayQueueTest passes), `:shared:compileAndroidMain`,
> `:androidApp:compileDebugKotlin`, full `:androidApp:assembleDebug` (APK). **Only iOS can't build
> here** (Windows, no Xcode — `iosSimulatorArm64Test` is auto-disabled). **After editing, run the
> relevant compile/test task** — reasoning alone missed real errors the build caught (a `/*` in a
> KDoc, `parameter()` not on `defaultRequest`, missing `ImageColorExtractor` actuals, etc.). Do NOT
> run GUI tasks (`:desktopApp:run`/`hotRun`) non-interactively — they hang.

### Version-coupling rules (when editing versions)

- Kotlin, Compose Multiplatform, and the Compose Compiler plugin are tightly coupled. The
  Compose Compiler plugin (`org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`) version **is** the `kotlin`
  version ref. Compose Multiplatform and the JB `material3` artifact are pinned separately.
- AGP ↔ Kotlin compatibility: check Google's
  [AGP/Kotlin support table](https://developer.android.com/build/kotlin-support).
- CMP ↔ Kotlin compatibility: check
  [Compose Multiplatform releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/releases).
- KSP is **not** used. Do not add it unless a specific annotation processor requires it.
- If SQLDelight is added (D3), its Gradle plugin version and runtime version MUST match.

### Key structural points

- **`:shared` is an Android *library*** via `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library`
  (it produces an AAR for the Android target). Android-only deps (Media3, Palette, DataStore)
  are scoped to `androidMain`.
- **`iosApp` is not a Gradle module** — it's an Xcode project consuming the `Shared`
  framework. Do not add `include(":iosApp")` to `settings.gradle.kts`.
- The package is `com.leejlredstar.redefinencm.kmp` (the original Android app used
  `com.redstar.redefinencm`). All new KMP code goes under the new package.

---

## How playback & lyrics work (ported contract)

1. A queue is a `List<MediaInfo>` whose `placeholderUri` is
   `redefinencm://playbackPlaceHolder?id=<songId>` — **not** a real audio URL.
2. Each platform's `PlatformPlayer` resolves the placeholder to a real CDN stream URL at play
   time via `NCMApi.songUrlV1()` (a `StreamUrlResolver`). Stream URLs are **never persisted**
   — they expire and are fetched fresh per session.
3. `NowPlayingViewModel` mirrors `PlatformPlayer`'s `StateFlow`s (state, position, duration,
   currentMedia, queue, currentIndex, shuffleEnabled) to the UI.
4. Lyric pipeline: `PlatformPlayer.position` → `LyricBus` → `LyricParser` matches the parsed
   LRC `LinkedHashMap<Long?, String?>` → current index → UI scroll **and**
   `LyricNotificationController.updateLyric(...)` (notification / Dynamic Island / floating
   window).

### Shuffle / queue ordering invariant (FROM ORIGINAL — DO NOT BREAK)

The visible queue (`playList`), the ordering it implies, and the current-item highlight
(`currentMediaIndexInList`) **must always be rebuilt together** from the player's current
state, via a single `rebuildPlaylistFromTimeline()` path. Every track transition, shuffle
toggle, and timeline change goes through that one function. Never read one value from cache
and another from live state — that is the original shuffle-misalignment bug.

The pure, unit-tested model of this now lives in **`player/PlayQueue.kt`** (immutable;
`currentItem == itemsInPlayOrder[positionInPlayOrder]` holds by construction) with a full
regression suite in **`commonTest/.../player/PlayQueueTest.kt`**. `PlatformPlayer` actuals
should delegate ordering to `PlayQueue` rather than re-deriving it. `NowPlayingViewModel`
still uses the simplified `player.queue` + `player.currentIndex` form and should be migrated
to drive `PlayQueue` when the real players land.

---

## Dependency management

`gradle/libs.versions.toml` is the **single source of truth**. Never hardcode versions in
`build.gradle.kts`; reference via `libs.<alias>`.

### Declared dependency set (matches what the code imports)

As of the 2026-06-11 build-fix pass, `libs.versions.toml` + `shared/build.gradle.kts` declare
exactly what the source imports — verified by grepping every third-party `import` in
`shared/src`. Versions are the verified June-2026 latest **compatible with the existing
Kotlin 2.3.21 pairing** (the toolchain bump to 2.4.0/AGP 9.2.0 was deliberately NOT bundled
in — see Goal #4).

| Area | Library (version) | Where |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | Ktor `3.5.0`: client-core, content-negotiation, logging, serialization-kotlinx-json | commonMain |
| HTTP engines | okhttp (androidMain), darwin (iosMain), cio (jvmMain) | per-platform |
| Serialization | `kotlinx-serialization-json 1.11.0` + `kotlin.plugin.serialization` (@kotlin) | commonMain / plugins |
| Concurrency | `kotlinx-coroutines-core 1.11.0` | commonMain |
| DI | Koin `4.2.1`: koin-core, koin-compose | commonMain |
| Images | Coil `3.5.0`: coil-compose (group `io.coil-kt.coil3`) | commonMain |
| Android settings | `androidx.datastore:datastore-preferences 1.2.0` | androidMain |
| Android audio | `media3-exoplayer 1.10.1` + `media3-session 1.10.1` | androidMain + :androidApp |

**Status update (2026-07-04):**
- **`multiplatform-settings`** — still deliberately NOT a dependency; `PlatformSettings` is a
  hand-rolled `expect class` (DataStore / `NSUserDefaults` / JVM prefs / `localStorage`).
- **Voyager / any navigation lib** — still not a dependency; `App.kt` uses a hand-rolled
  tab + push-stack navigation (3 tabs, NavigationRail on ≥600dp) — this is the decided approach.
- **SQLDelight `2.3.2`** — now present (see D3).
- **`androidx.palette:palette-ktx 1.0.0`** — now present in `androidMain`; drives
  `themeColorFromCoilImage()` (muted → vibrant → dominant, same as the original ImageParser).
- **`coil-network-ktor3`** — now present; remote album art loads via the Ktor stack
  (`RedefineNCMApp` registers `KtorNetworkFetcherFactory`).

### Goal #4 — "upgrade all dependencies to latest" (a *verified* pass)

This is its own task and **must not be done from memory**:

1. For every version, check the **current latest** on Maven Central / the library's release
   notes (use WebSearch/WebFetch). Do not assert "latest" without checking — versions in this
   file may already be post-cutoff for any given agent.
2. Respect the coupling rules above (Kotlin ↔ CMP ↔ Compose Compiler; AGP ↔ Kotlin).
3. **Converge shared versions across both repos** (Kotlin, coroutines, serialization, AGP).
   At minimum bring this repo up to the original's Kotlin `2.4.0` / AGP `9.2.0`, then apply
   whatever newer verified set both repos can share.
4. Validate in a **real toolchain** (Android SDK + JDK 17 + macOS/Xcode for iOS). A bump that
   only "looks right" here is unverified.

## Conventions

- **Commit messages:** When creating commits or rewriting existing commit messages, use the
  Conventional Commit style below. Header is required. Body and Footer are optional. Commit
  message prose MUST be English.
- Header format MUST be `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`, or `<type>: <subject>` when scope is
  omitted.
  - `type` is required and MUST be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`,
    `perf`, `test`, `chore`, or `revert`.
  - `scope` is optional and names the affected module or feature.
  - `subject` is required, should be concise, and should usually stay within 50 characters.
- If Body is present, separate it from the Header with one blank line. Use it to explain the
  motivation, concrete changes, and behavior differences from the previous version.
- If Footer is present, separate it from the Body, or from the Header when Body is omitted,
  with one blank line. Use it for Breaking Changes and closed issue references such as
  `Closes #123`.
- Do not treat Body or Footer as mandatory. Do not reinterpret "English" as "ASCII-only"
  unless the user explicitly asks for that stricter rule.
- Example:
  ```text
  feat(user): add user registration

  Implement registration by email and phone number.
  Tighten user data validation.

  Closes #456
  ```
- If asked to fix non-compliant commit messages, rewrite only the messages that violate this
  rule and preserve the committed file trees.
- **Kotlin official style** (`kotlin.code.style=official`).
- **Compose Multiplatform UI for all platforms.** No SwiftUI/native UI except platform chrome
  (Live Activity widget, floating window, notifications). iOS entry is
  `ComposeUIViewController { App() }` — the UI is Compose, not SwiftUI.
- **`org.jetbrains.compose.*` only in `commonMain`** — never `androidx.compose.*` directly,
  and never `LocalContext`/`LocalLifecycleOwner`/other `androidx.compose.ui.platform.Local*`
  (they don't exist off-Android). Use expect/actual wrappers.
- **State down via `StateFlow`/`collectAsState`, events up via lambdas.** No two-way binding.
- **DI: Koin.** Platform singletons (Ktor engine, `PlatformPlayer`, `PlatformSettings`) come
  from `platformModule()` actuals; load platform module before `sharedModule`.
- **HTTP: wrap every call in `safeApiCall { }`** (returns `T?`, swallows exceptions → `null`).
- **Serialization: kotlinx.serialization** with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true`, `isLenient = true`,
  `coerceInputValues = true`; `@SerialName` for divergent JSON keys (`ar`, `al`, …).
- **Do NOT reference** Room, Retrofit, OkHttp-as-API, Hilt, or Gson in shared code — they are
  Android-only and replaced by SQLDelight / Ktor / Koin / kotlinx.serialization. (OkHttp may
  appear only as a Ktor *engine* in `androidMain`.)
- **Preserve inline Chinese comments** — they carry porting intent from the original.

---

## UI design requirements (Material 3 Expressive)

Applies to all platforms, and the original Android repo is kept aligned (goal #3).

- **Color:** `surface` for page bases; `surfaceContainerHigh` / `surfaceContainerHighest` for
  tonal panels and list rows. Album-art–derived accents via `ImageColorExtractor` as gradient
  endpoints / highlights.
- **Shape — connected-list language:** large outer corners (~28dp), tight inner corners
  (~6dp), small vertical gaps (~1.5dp) between rows; implemented in
  `ui/component/Expressive.kt` (`connectedListItemShape()`). Interactive elements use pill
  (`RoundedCornerShape(50%)`) or `extraLarge` shapes.
- **Typography:** aggressive weight/size contrast — bold headlines (`DisplaySmall`,
  `HeadlineLarge`), regular body, lighter captions. Use the M3 Expressive type scale.
- **Prefer the real Expressive APIs** (`MaterialExpressiveTheme`, motion scheme) where the
  pinned `material3` version provides them, rather than only custom shapes on plain
  `MaterialTheme` (current `Theme.kt` is the latter — an approximation; upgrade it).
- **Per-screen:** NowPlaying (album-art hero gradient, oversized rounded cover ~252dp, bold
  marquee title); Playlist detail (album-color gradient header, pill "Play All", connected
  rows with download indicators); User page (blurred hero + avatar, badged playlists);
  Search (pill→bar shared-element transition, suggestion list); Downloads (queue summary hero,
  progress rows, pause/resume/cancel/retry controls); Settings (gradient hero, tonal rows, pill
  actions); Mini-player FAB (image-derived color w/ adaptive content luminance via
  `contrastingTextColor()`, oversized rounded shape).
- **Desktop floating window:** frameless/translucent, blur-behind, current lyric + mini art +
  compact controls, always-on-top toggle (part of the JVM `LyricNotificationController`).
- **iOS Live Activity:** Lock Screen + Dynamic Island — artwork thumbnail, title, artist,
  current lyric, synced to position.

## Build & run

Prereqs: JDK 17, Android SDK (compileSdk 36 / build-tools / minSdk 24), Xcode 16+ (iOS,
macOS only), IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio with the KMP plugin.

```sh
# Android
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
# Desktop
./gradlew :desktopApp:run
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest
# iOS (macOS only) — then open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj in Xcode
./gradlew :shared:iosSimulatorArm64Test
# Web (after D2 — declaring the wasmJs target)
./gradlew :shared:wasmJsBrowserRun
# All tests
./gradlew :shared:allTests
```

`usesCleartextTraffic="true"` must be set in `androidApp`'s manifest (self-hosted HTTP API).

## Current divergence from this spec

This is the **only** section describing what's broken/missing. Treat it as the work queue.
Everything above describes the target; everything here is a gap to close.

### Feature-parity pass vs the original app — DONE + BUILD-VERIFIED (2026-07-04)
Full file-by-file audit against `../RedefineNCM` (frozen 2026-06-12), then closed every gap
(Android + common; other targets get stubs per current priority):
- **fetchUID** now really calls `/user/account` and caches the UID (was a stub that never
  fetched); `refreshAccount()` clears it on account switch.
- **QR login fix**: the QR PNG bytes were never assigned → image never showed; now decoded
  from base64 locally.
- **Shuffle invariant restored**: `ExoPlayerPlatformPlayer.rebuildQueue()` walks the timeline
  in *play order* (`getFirstWindowIndex`/`getNextWindowIndex`), `skipToIndex` maps play-order →
  window index, and transitions/shuffle-toggles/timeline changes all trigger the single rebuild
  path; `NowPlayingViewModel` now collects `queue`/`currentIndex` live.
- **Player-status persistence**: `PlayerStatus.sq` + `Repository.get/savePlayerStatus` +
  `PlatformPlayer.restoreQueue` (no autoplay) + save on `MainActivity.onPause`.
- **Download manager**: `SongDownloadManager` owns the common queue/state model. The Downloads
  page remains as an internal route (pause/resume/cancel/retry/clear/delete local files), but
  the common tab/sidebar entry is removed; on Android, `AndroidDownloadService` runs downloads as
  a foreground data-sync service and its notification is the entry point into that page. It stores
  the actual downloaded quality from
  `/song/url/v1`'s returned `level` and prefetches/caches lyrics in SQLDelight after the audio file
  is written. Local-library sync is snapshot-based, not ID-only: platform scans return
  `DownloadedSongSnapshot` (song ID, file name, URI, size, modified time), `DownloadedSongsCache`
  caches that snapshot for O(1) row indicators, and `SongDownloadManager.syncWithLocalLibrary()`
  reconciles queued tasks with real files while importing disk-only downloads as Completed rows
  with best-effort `/song/detail` metadata. `SongDownloader` actuals only stream files to the
  platform download folder. Android writes `Downloads/RedefineNCM/` through `MediaStore` instead of
  the system `DownloadManager`; JVM writes `~/Music/RedefineNCM/`; iOS remains an explicit
  unsupported actual until an NSURLSession-backed writer is implemented.
- **Playlist behaviors**: `replacePlaylist` setting honored on song click,
  `playlistUpdatePlaycount` reported, no auto-jump to NowPlaying (original behavior).
- **Album-art theme color**: `themeColorFromCoilImage()` expect/actual (Android Palette /
  JVM Skia sampling / iOS stub) wired into MiniNowPlayingBar (with luminance-adaptive content
  color + spring animation), NowPlaying hero, PlaylistDetail hero, FullLyric hero.
- **Search shared-element transition** (pill → bar) via `SharedTransitionLayout` in HomeScreen.
- **Responsive nav**: NavigationRail on ≥600dp; no-cookie startup routes to Login.
- **Settings**: server availability check (`/inner/version/`), `adaptOriginalAndroidLyric`
  toggle (unconsumed, same as original); comment cache table; live-update notification uses
  the lyric as its title (original behavior).
- **Update check on launch** (checkUpdate setting → GitHub releases/latest → Snackbar).
- Skipped intentionally: `HiddenTestActivity`, `serverMocker` (dev tools), `dailysignin`
  (declared but never called in the original either).

### Build catalog — DONE + BUILD-VERIFIED (Android + Desktop, 2026-06-11)
- [x] `libs.versions.toml` + `shared/build.gradle.kts` declare every dependency the code imports
      (Ktor 3.5.0, kotlinx-serialization-json 1.11.0 + plugin, kotlinx-coroutines-core 1.11.0,
      Koin 4.2.1 + koin-android, Coil 3.5.0 coil-compose, datastore + androidx.core on androidMain,
      `compose.materialIconsExtended` + `compose.material3` on :desktopApp). Engines scoped per
      source set (okhttp/darwin/cio).
- [x] kotlinx-serialization Gradle plugin applied (root `apply false` + `:shared`).
- [x] Dead `shared/src/desktopMain/` deleted (D1).
- [x] **VERIFIED GREEN:** `:shared:compileKotlinJvm`, `:desktopApp:compileKotlin`,
      `:shared:jvmTest` (PlayQueueTest passes), `:shared:compileAndroidMain`,
      `:androidApp:compileDebugKotlin`, `:androidApp:assembleDebug` (APK). iOS not buildable here
      (Windows/no Xcode). The build caught several issues reading had missed — all fixed:
      KDoc `/*`, `defaultRequest` lacking `parameter()` (use `url.parameters.append`), missing
      `ImageColorExtractor` actuals, desktopApp missing material3, androidx.core too old for
      `setRequestPromotedOngoing`, and a `PlayQueueTest` `List<String>`/`List<String?>` inference.
- Note: `compose.materialIconsExtended` is deprecated (pinned 1.7.3, no updates) — works for now;
  migrate to Material Symbols / vector resources eventually.

### Goal #4 toolchain convergence — Kotlin DONE+verified; AGP deferred
- [x] **Kotlin `2.3.21 → 2.4.0`** (+ CMP `1.11.0 → 1.11.1`) — bumped and **build-verified** on
      Android + Desktop (with AGP 9.0.1 / Gradle 9.1.0). Kotlin is now converged with the original.
- [ ] **AGP `9.0.1 → 9.2.0` deferred.** Empirically (2026-06-11): AGP 9.2.0 needs Gradle ≥ 9.4.1;
      after bumping the wrapper, it then fails to resolve `com.android.tools.build:aapt2:9.2.0` and
      breaks configuration-cache serialization of `MergeResources`. Reverted to the green
      9.0.1/9.1.0. Revisit when those AGP-9.2 issues clear (or disable config cache to retry).

### Dead / leftover code
- [x] **`Greeting.kt` / `GreetingUtil.kt` + `compose-multiplatform.xml` deleted** (2026-06-13) — template stubs removed; no references existed.
- [ ] **`wasmJsMain/` is dormant** (D2: target intentionally not declared; web is P3). Its
      `Platform.wasm.kt` and `WasmNotificationStub` reference an interface shape that doesn't
      exist (`Platform.isDesktop/isMobile`) — they must be reconciled with the real
      `Platform` interface (which currently has only `name`) **and** the wasm deps added
      (`ktor-client-js`, `kotlinx-browser` for `localStorage`) when web is enabled.

### Latent runtime gaps (compile fine; will surface when exercised)
- [x] **HttpClient base URL / cookie wired** (2026-06-11) — every `platformModule()` now builds
      its client via `HttpClientFactory.create(baseUrl, realIP, cookie, engine)`, sourcing
      `baseUrl` (SettingKeys.SERVER, default `http://ncm.tryagain.icu/`) and `cookie`
      (SettingKeys.COOKIE) from `PlatformSettings`. `HttpClientFactory.create` was completed to
      port the original's interceptor (base URL + `realIP` 192.168.1.1 + `timestamp` cache-buster
      via Ktor `getTimeMillis()` + cleaned cookie header). Remaining nuances: (a) the client is a
      Koin singleton built once, so changing server/cookie takes effect next launch (matches the
      original `RetrofitInstance` object); (b) cookie is attached whenever non-empty rather than
      skipped on `/login/*` (Ktor `defaultRequest` can't see the per-request path) — refine with a
      send-pipeline interceptor if strict per-path skipping is needed.
- [x] **`kotlinx-coroutines-swing` added to `shared/jvmMain`** (2026-06-13) — `Dispatchers.Main` now resolvable in `jvmTest` and `DesktopFloatingWindowController`; still present in `desktopApp` (harmless duplicate).
- [x] **Coil network fetcher added** (`coil-network-ktor3`) — remote album art loads;
      `RedefineNCMApp` registers `KtorNetworkFetcherFactory`.
- [ ] **`Platform` interface has only `name`.** If form-factor branching is wanted, add
      `isDesktop`/`isMobile` (with defaults) to the interface and update all actuals — the
      removed `desktopMain` and the dormant wasm code assumed these existed.

### Misplaced / misnamed
- [x] **`MediaControlsIntegrator` moved to commonMain** (2026-06-11) — now in
      `commonMain/smtc/MediaControls.kt`; the misnamed `jvmMain/.../WindowsSmtcIntegration.kt` was
      deleted and replaced by `jvmMain/smtc/WindowsMediaControls.kt` (the OS binding home).

### Implemented as stub / not wired
- [~] **`App.kt` now renders the real screen** (2026-06-11) — `App()` is
      `RedefineNCMTheme { Surface { NowPlayingScreen() } }` (no more "Click me!" template).
      DI graph is now both defined *and* initialised; **build-unverified** but reasoning-verified:
      - [x] **PlatformPlayer binding** — `sharedModule` binds `InMemoryPlatformPlayer` (pure-Kotlin
        reference player over the tested `PlayQueue`; no real audio). Android `platformModule()` now
        overrides this with `ExoPlayerPlatformPlayer` (see Android audio backend below).
      - [x] **Fixed latent DI bug** — `NowPlayingViewModel` was bound with 3 `get()`s but its 3rd
        param `lyricBus = LyricBus` is an object default → now 2 `get()`s.
      - [x] **`initKoin()` wired in all entry points** — idempotent `initKoin(config)` in
        `di/Modules.kt` (guards on `GlobalContext.getOrNull()`). Desktop `main.kt` and iOS
        `MainViewController` call `initKoin()`; Android `RedefineNCMApp : Application` calls
        `initKoin { androidContext(this) }` (so `PlatformSettings(get())` resolves the Context) +
        `LyricNotificationController.init(...)`. Added `koin-android` to `:androidApp`; registered
        the Application + INTERNET/POST_NOTIFICATIONS perms + `usesCleartextTraffic` in the manifest.
      - **BUILD-VERIFIED on Android + Desktop (2026-06-11):** `:androidApp:assembleDebug` (APK),
        `:desktopApp:compileKotlin`, `:shared:jvmTest` all green — the DI graph (incl. koin-compose
        global-context fallback) compiles/assembles; the Android Application + manifest are valid.
        **iOS path unverified** (no Mac). Now (2026-06-11): **Home is the entry** + a hand-rolled
        back-stack nav (`App.kt`) with Home / Search / PlaylistDetail / Login / NowPlaying screens,
        all M3 Expressive and build-verified. Remaining: (1) User + Settings screens + QR-login UI;
        (2) RUN it (`:desktopApp:run`, GUI) to confirm runtime DI/render; JVM audio backend still
        needed (Desktop still uses `InMemoryPlatformPlayer`); iOS AVPlayer backend deferred (needs Mac).
- [x] **Android audio backend — ExoPlayer + MediaSession, BUILD-VERIFIED** (2026-06-13).
      `media3-exoplayer 1.10.1` + `media3-session` added to `androidMain` (and to `:androidApp`
      directly for `PlaybackService`).
      - `shared/src/androidMain/player/RedirectingDataSourceFactory` intercepts
        `redefinencm://playbackPlaceHolder?id=xxx` URIs and resolves to real CDN URLs via
        `Repository.getSongUrl()` (runBlocking on ExoPlayer's IO thread — same as original).
      - `shared/src/androidMain/player/ExoPlayerPlatformPlayer` is a Koin singleton (created on
        the main thread in `androidContext()`); implements all `PlatformPlayer` StateFlows via
        `Player.Listener`; position synced every 200 ms while playing.
      - `AndroidPlatformModule.platformModule()` now overrides the shared `InMemoryPlatformPlayer`
        binding with `ExoPlayerPlatformPlayer`.
      - `androidApp/PlaybackService` is a `MediaSessionService`; wraps the same Koin-singleton
        ExoPlayer in a `MediaSession` for OS media controls; registered in `AndroidManifest.xml`
        with `foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"` + required foreground-service permissions.
      - Lyric sync added to `NowPlayingViewModel.initLyricSync()` — combines `currentPosition` +
        `lyricMap` → `lyricIndex` + calls `LyricNotificationController.updateLyric(...)`.
      - **Build-verified:** `:shared:compileAndroidMain`, `:androidApp:compileDebugKotlin`,
        `:androidApp:assembleDebug` (APK), `:shared:compileKotlinJvm`, `:shared:jvmTest` all green.
      - **Remaining for JVM/Desktop:** JVM player backed by `mp3spi` / `javax.sound.sampled` (the
        Desktop still uses `InMemoryPlatformPlayer`).
      - **Remaining for iOS:** AVPlayer-backed `PlatformPlayer` in `iosMain` (needs Mac + Xcode).
- [~] **Windows SMTC — pipeline wired (compile-verified), native OS binding TODO** (2026-06-11).
      `MediaControlMetadata` + `MediaControlsIntegrator` are in `commonMain/smtc/MediaControls.kt`;
      `NowPlayingViewModel` feeds it (title/artist/album/duration/isPlaying); `jvmMain/smtc/
      WindowsMediaControls` observes it (started from `desktopApp/main.kt`). The final OS push is a
      no-op pending a **native WinRT helper DLL** (SMTC has no runtime-verifiable JVM/JNA-WinRT
      path) — precise recipe is in the `WindowsMediaControls` KDoc. Linux MPRIS / macOS
      MPNowPlayingInfoCenter are analogous, also TODO.
- [~] **iOS Live Activity — Swift source written** (2026-06-11), Xcode target wiring is the only
      remaining (build-gated) step. Added: `iosApp/LyricWidget/` (`LyricActivityAttributes`,
      `LyricLiveActivity` = Lock Screen + Dynamic Island UI, `LyricWidgetBundle`, `Info.plist`),
      `iosApp/iosApp/LiveActivityManager.swift` (drives `Activity.request/update/end` from the
      Kotlin stream), `iOSApp.swift` starts it, app `Info.plist` sets `NSSupportsLiveActivities`.
      Kotlin `LyricNotificationController` gained `startObserving/stopObserving` for Swift. Uses
      ActivityKit `ContentState` (no App Group needed for text; artwork-in-LA = App-Group TODO).
      **Remaining:** add the Widget Extension target in Xcode + target memberships — see
      `iosApp/LyricWidget/SETUP.md`. Like all platform now-playing surfaces, it only shows once
      the playback/lyric pipeline calls `LyricNotificationController.updateLyric(...)`.
- [x] **Desktop floating window is wired** (2026-06-11) — `desktopApp/main.kt` now opens a
      second frameless / translucent / always-on-top Compose window that renders
      `DesktopFloatingWindowController`'s `floatingLyricData` when `isWindowVisible` is true.
      Remaining: the playback/lyric pipeline must call `LyricNotificationController.show()` +
      `updateLyric(...)` to populate it (today nothing drives it, so it stays hidden).
- [x] **`Theme.kt` now uses real `MaterialExpressiveTheme`** (2026-06-11) with
      `MotionScheme.expressive()` + the Expressive shape/type scales. Remaining: dynamic /
      album-art–derived color schemes via an expect/actual provider (`dynamicColorScheme` is
      Android-only).

### Not started
- [x] **SQLDelight cache** (D3) — DONE (plugin + 9 tables + drivers + cache-then-network +
      PlayerStatus queue persistence; build-verified 2026-07-04).
- [x] **`PlayQueue` + `PlayQueueTest`** (shuffle regression suite) — DONE (2026-06-11), pure
      Kotlin, fully reasoned (build-unverified like everything here). Next: have the real
      `PlatformPlayer` actuals + `NowPlayingViewModel` delegate to `PlayQueue`.
- [ ] Domain model layer (DTO → domain mapping), if desired.
- [ ] Voyager navigation wiring (confirm whether Voyager is the chosen nav or remove it).
- [ ] Goal #4 verified dependency upgrade + cross-repo version convergence.
- [ ] CI pipeline.
